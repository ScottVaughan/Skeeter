To get webpack working:

install webpack:
	npm install webpack --save

install loaders:
	npm install extract-text-webpack-plugin --save
 	npm install --save exports-loader imports-loader less-loader url-loader

npm install --save bootstrap-webpack

webpack --progress --colors -d --watch




Note: if you copy it out of here it maynot work. You might have to type it. 
if you are using any os that is not stupid windows, your webpack.config.js:
module.exports = {
  context: __dirname + "/app",
...

if you are using windows, your webpack.config.js:
var p = require('path');
module.exports = {
	context: p.join(__dirnam,'app'),
...


If you get error because of database:

Open server.js and commend out these 2 line-
	var mongoose = require('mongoose');
	var db = mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/list');

...

Node module was reset just to install mongoose. The old modules are in modules.old just so I wouldn't delete them. We can change them back whenever we want.
